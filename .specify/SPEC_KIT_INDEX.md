# Get Emacs Spec-Kit - Complete Implementation Roadmap

## Project Overview
Systematic implementation of an AI-powered Emacs development environment that surpasses VSCode capabilities through three progressive stages, from functional foundation to mastery-level optimization.

## Staged Implementation Approach

### 🚀 Stage 001: Functional Emacs Foundation
**Timeline**: 7 days | **Focus**: Reliable, performant base system
```
✅ Emacs 30+ with native compilation (< 2s startup)
✅ GitHub Copilot CLI integration for code completion  
✅ Essential packages: projectile, magit, ivy/counsel, use-package
✅ Core development: navigation, search, project management
✅ Terminal integration with Ghostty/Zsh compatibility
✅ Git workflow with Magit for version control
```
**Deliverable**: A rock-solid Emacs environment competitive with VSCode basics

### 🌟 Stage 002: Enhanced Development Environment  
**Timeline**: 4 weeks | **Focus**: Advanced IDE capabilities
```
✅ LSP integration for 5+ languages (Python, JS/TS, Go, Rust, C++)
✅ Multi-AI orchestration (Claude, Gemini, Copilot coordination)
✅ UV-first Python development with full lifecycle support
✅ Advanced Git workflows with forge integration
✅ Outlook.com email integration with mu4e automation
✅ Project templates and development workflow automation
```
**Deliverable**: Sophisticated AI-orchestrated IDE exceeding modern tool capabilities

### 🏆 Stage 003: Mastery and Optimization
**Timeline**: 6-8 weeks | **Focus**: Performance excellence and automation
```
✅ Performance optimization (< 1s startup, faster than VSCode)
✅ Custom Elisp package development for specific workflows
✅ Advanced AI workflow orchestration with predictive automation
✅ Comprehensive knowledge management and documentation system  
✅ Teaching and onboarding framework for new users
✅ Community contributions and open source package development
```
**Deliverable**: The ultimate Emacs development environment setting new productivity standards

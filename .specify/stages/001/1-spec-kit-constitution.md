# Spec-Kit Constitution - Stage 001: Functional Emacs Foundation

## Project Vision
Create the first functional AI-powered Emacs development environment that surpasses VSCode capabilities through systematic implementation of modern tooling and comprehensive documentation.

## Stage 001 Objectives
**Goal**: Establish a rock-solid, functional Emacs foundation with essential AI integration.

### Core Principles
1. **Functional First**: Every feature must work reliably before enhancement
2. **AI-Native**: Built with GitHub Copilot CLI, Claude, and Gemini integration from day one
3. **UV-First Development**: Modern Python tooling and package management
4. **Performance-Centric**: Native compilation and optimized configurations
5. **Documentation-Driven**: Every implementation thoroughly documented

### Success Criteria for Stage 001
‚úÖ **Emacs 30+ Installation**: Native compilation enabled with optimal performance
‚úÖ **Basic AI Integration**: GitHub Copilot CLI functional for code completion
‚úÖ **Essential Package Management**: use-package, straight.el, or similar working
‚úÖ **Core Editing Features**: Navigation, search, basic project management
‚úÖ **Terminal Integration**: Proper terminal emulation and shell interaction
‚úÖ **Git Integration**: Basic Magit functionality for version control

### Non-Goals for Stage 001
‚ùå Advanced language servers (defer to Stage 002)
‚ùå Complex AI workflows (defer to Stage 003)  
‚ùå Custom Elisp development (defer to Stage 002)
‚ùå Performance optimization beyond basics (defer to Stage 003)

## Implementation Approach

### Research Foundation
- **Primary Source**: The Emacs Artisan's Handbook comprehensive guide
- **Compass Artifact**: AI integration methodologies and UV-first principles
- **Real-World Testing**: Ubuntu 25.04 + modern development workflows

### Quality Standards
- **Reliability**: All features must work consistently across restarts
- **Performance**: Sub-2 second startup time with native compilation
- **Usability**: VSCode feature parity for basic development tasks
- **Maintainability**: Clear configuration structure for future enhancements

## Deliverables for Stage 001
1. **Functional Emacs Configuration**: Complete init.el with modular structure
2. **Installation Guide**: Step-by-step Ubuntu 25.04 setup instructions
3. **AI Integration**: Working GitHub Copilot CLI integration
4. **Basic Workflow Documentation**: Essential commands and usage patterns
5. **Performance Validation**: Benchmarks proving VSCode-competitive performance

## Success Metrics
- ‚ö° **Startup Time**: < 2 seconds cold start
- üîß **Feature Coverage**: 80% of VSCode essential features
- ü§ñ **AI Integration**: Functional code completion and assistance
- üìö **Documentation**: Complete setup and usage instructions
- üß™ **Reliability**: Zero configuration errors on fresh install
